# Shader Graphics Competition - Gopher Graphics Club
This project simulates the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction using C++ and OpenGL. The simulation visualizes the reaction's 
intricate and beautiful wave patterns in real time. This project is our submission for the shader graphics competition 
hosted by Gopher Graphics Club.
